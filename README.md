# Hi, I'm Shane (aka @NeilsBored) 

"Engineer–coder" exploring the seam between **AI, graphics, and human-interactive automation**.  
I like problems with real-world constraints and visible outcomes.

---

### What I’m building
- **Small, sharp tools** that make teams faster — from ML-flavored analytics to workflow automation.
- **Interactive/graphics experiments** that blend aesthetics with systems thinking.
- Occasional **embedded/IoT** tinkering when it helps close the loop with the physical world.

### Learning (right now)
- Practical machine learning: model evaluation, data plumbing, and deployment patterns.
- GPU/graphics pipelines for real-time, human-in-the-loop systems.
- Better product habits: road-mapping, instrumentation, and measurable outcomes.

### Collaborate with me
I’m open to thoughtful projects where the goal is clear, the impact is real, and the repo stays tidy.  
Bring your domain problem; I’ll bring code, questions, and a bias for shipping.

<p>I’m Nobody! Who are you?
Are you – Nobody – too?
Then there’s a pair of us!
Don't tell! they'd advertise – you know!

How dreary – to be – Somebody!
How public – like a Frog –
To tell one’s name – the livelong June –
To an admiring Bog!</p>
